<h1 align="center">Welcome to sigma-comp-club ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>It's an admin panel to manage computer club status. Book desks for your customers, stash computers, see club users, stats, etc.</p>

<p>Project was created with a purpose of getting experience with SQL queries and SSR (server-side rendering). I've also gained experience with <strong>Express.js</strong> by configuring routing and creating middlewares.</p>
<hr>

<p>Stack: Express.js, Pug, Bulma.io, HTMX, MySQL</p>
<p>To sum up. I had a great time creating views using <strong>Pug</strong> templating engine, raw SQL (with MySQL) and <strong>HTMX</strong>.</p>
